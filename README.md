# Getting Started with Color

A single page application that can show you monotone color palettes with different shades (S and L).
The base idea is to get the hue from the user and use that to create the palette. 

### Setting up

- In order to run the application on your local machine, follow the steps given below:

1. Install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/] 
2. Clone the repository. You can paste the following command in your local shell/terminal.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SscSPs/color.git
   ```
3. Enter the local directory

   ```sh
   cd color
   ```
3. Install the required npm packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application 
    ```sh
    npm start
   ```
   This runs the application in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

   The page will reload if you make edits.\
   You will also see any lint errors in the console.
